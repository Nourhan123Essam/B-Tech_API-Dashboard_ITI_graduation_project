# üõí E-Commerce Backend API

## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Backend API** repository! This project is divided into two main components:  
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Built using **ASP.NET MVC** for managing administrative functionality.  
2. **Public Website Backend**: Developed as an **ASP.NET Web API** to handle public-facing operations.  

### üìå Note:
This documentation highlights **only the parts of the project** that I have contributed to. While I played a key role in several areas (outlined below), other contributors worked on additional features not detailed here. I hope this README offers clear insight into the areas I focused on. üòä

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. **Admin Dashboard**  
The **Admin Dashboard** provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage orders, view order details, and perform various actions like updating, canceling, or deleting orders.

#### üîß My Contributions:
- Implemented **CRUD operations** for the **Order** entity in the **MVC** project.  
- Ensured smooth integration with the Onion Architecture layers for maintainability and scalability.

### 2. **Public Website Backend**  
The **Public Website Backend** is a RESTful API that handles key public-facing functionalities, including order management, cart operations, and payment processing.  

#### üîß My Contributions:
1. **Order and OrderItem Management**  
   - Implemented **CRUD operations** for the **Order** and **OrderItem** entities in the `OrderController`.  
     - Each order contains a collection of order items, with foreign key relationships linking the `Order` to its `OrderItems` and the `OrderItems` to their associated products.
     - Ensured smooth handling of the order lifecycle, from creation to updates and deletions.

2. **Cart Operations**  
   - Developed cart management logic within the `OrderController` to enable seamless cart functionality.  
     - The cart is represented as an **Order** with a status of `InCart`.  
     - Users can view their cart contents from any browser, making use of persistent storage.

3. **PayPal Integration**  
   - Integrated **PayPal** payment functionality via a dedicated `PayPalController`.  
     - Streamlined payment workflows by enabling secure order payment processing with PayPal's API.

### üßÖ Onion Architecture Breakdown  

This project follows **Onion Architecture** to promote separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

#### 1. **DbContextB** (Database Access)
   - Provides the entry point to interact with the database using **Entity Framework Core**.
   - Contains the **BTechDbContext** that manages the connection to the database and tracks entities like Order, OrderItem, etc.

#### 2. **DTOsB** (Data Transfer Objects)
   - Contains the **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) used to transfer data between Services in Application layer and Controllers in MVC, and API layers.
   - Examples include SelectOrderBDTO, AddOrUpdateOrderBDTO.

#### 3. **InfrastructureB** (Database Interaction)
   - Contains the implementation for accessing and interacting with the database.
   - Implements the **Repository Patterns** for CRUD operations.

#### 4. **ModelsB** (Entities)
   - Defines the core **domain models** used throughout the system.
   - Includes entities like Order, OrderItem.

#### 5. **ApplicationB** (Business Logic)
   - Encapsulates the business logic of the application.
   - Implements the service layer interacting with the **InfrastructureB** to fetch or persist data, and uses **DTOsB** to manage data flow between the controllers and the core application.
